1. Description:
   This homework assignment involves providing a proof of the Master Theorem, a mathematical theorem used in the analysis of algorithms. Students are required to submit handwritten work demonstrating their understanding of all three scenarios within the Master Theorem, specifically covering cases 1 to 3 in detail.

2. What could I learn?:
   From this homework, students can learn the following:
   - Mastery of the Master Theorem, a key concept in algorithm analysis.
   - How to apply the Master Theorem to analyze and determine the time complexity of algorithms.
   - Developing clear and detailed mathematical proofs.

3. Submission:
   a. Where to submit: undefined.
   b. Deadline: The submission deadline is 23:59 on October 11th.
   c. Submission format: Students are required to submit clear photos or scans of their handwritten work as proof of the Master Theorem. Digital submissions are not specified, so handwritten work is likely expected.
   d. Score details:
      - Completing the proof for all three scenarios (cases 1 to 3) is essential.
      - Avoiding the use of incorrect proofs, especially those found online, is highly recommended.
      - Late submissions within the one-week grace period will receive a reduced score of 70% of the total score.

This assignment provides a practical opportunity for students to reinforce their understanding of the Master Theorem and its application in algorithm analysis. It also encourages precision in mathematical proof writing.
