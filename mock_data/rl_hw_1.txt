1. Description:
   Lab 2, "Deep Q-Network (DQN)," aims to introduce and implement the Deep Q-Network algorithm by solving the MsPacman-v5 environment. Students will work on constructing neural networks, selecting actions using epsilon-greedy, calculating loss functions, and updating behavior and target networks. They will also learn about the mechanisms of the behavior and target networks, as well as experience replay buffers. Common techniques in Atari environments, such as frame stacking and grayscale, are covered in this lab.

2. What could I learn?:
   In this lab, students can learn the following:
   - Understanding the mechanisms of behavior and target networks.
   - Understanding the mechanism of the experience replay buffer.
   - How to construct and design neural networks.
   - Implementation of the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm.
   - Action selection using epsilon-greedy.
   - Constructing Q-values and target Q-values.
   - Calculating loss functions and updating networks.
   - Deep Q-learning mechanisms and techniques in Atari environments.
